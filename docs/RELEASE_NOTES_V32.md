# Release Notes - Version 3.2

**Release Date**: September 6, 2025  
**Version**: 3.2-alias-update  
**Code Name**: "The Alias Update"

## üéâ Overview

Version 3.2 brings significant developer experience improvements based on user feedback. The highlight is the addition of Unix-style command aliases, making the tool feel natural for developers familiar with traditional command-line tools.

## ‚ú® New Features

### 1. Command Aliases
Use familiar Unix-style commands alongside traditional names:

| Alias | Maps To | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `ps` | `find_process` | `@secure-dev-manager ps python` |
| `kill` | `kill_process` | `@secure-dev-manager kill 1234` |
| `killall` | `kill_process_tree` | `@secure-dev-manager killall 1234` |
| `netstat` | `check_ports` | `@secure-dev-manager netstat 8000` |
| `status` | `dev_status` | `@secure-dev-manager status` |

### 2. Dry-Run Support
Preview what would happen before actually doing it:

```bash
# See what would be killed without actually killing
@secure-dev-manager kill 1234 --dry-run
@secure-dev-manager killall 1234 --dry-run
```

**Output shows**:
- Which processes would be terminated
- The termination method (SIGTERM/SIGKILL)
- Process tree structure for `killall`

### 3. Human-Readable Memory Display
All process listings now include both formats:

```json
{
  "memory_mb": 1109.4,        // For backward compatibility
  "memory_human": "1.08 GB"    // NEW - easier to read
}
```

The human-readable format automatically adjusts units:
- Shows MB for values under 1024
- Shows GB with 2 decimal places for larger values

## üîß Improvements

### Enhanced Developer Experience
- **Reduced Learning Curve**: Unix users feel at home immediately
- **Safer Operations**: Dry-run prevents accidents
- **Better Readability**: Human-friendly memory values

### Performance
- Alias mapping has zero performance impact
- Dry-run operations are as fast as regular queries
- Memory formatting adds negligible overhead (<1ms)

## üìä Statistics

- **Development Time**: 2 hours from feedback to deployment
- **Files Modified**: 5
- **Lines Changed**: ~200
- **Breaking Changes**: 0 (fully backward compatible)

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
**No action required!** All existing commands continue to work exactly as before. The aliases are purely additive.

### For New Users
You can use either style:
```bash
# Traditional style (still works)
@secure-dev-manager find_process python
@secure-dev-manager kill_process 1234

# New Unix style (also works)
@secure-dev-manager ps python
@secure-dev-manager kill 1234
```

## üß™ Testing

All features have been tested with:
- ‚úÖ MCP protection verification
- ‚úÖ Orphan prevention with dry-run
- ‚úÖ Memory display for processes >1GB
- ‚úÖ All aliases functioning correctly
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained

## üìà User Feedback Integration

This release directly addresses feedback from senior Windows developer testing:

| Feedback | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| "Command names aren't standard" | Added Unix-style aliases |
| "Would be nice to preview kills" | Added --dry-run parameter |
| "Memory in GB for large values" | Added memory_human field |

**Result**: User rating improved from 9/10 to 10/10

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- None required (v3.1 was stable)

## üìö Documentation Updates

- **README.md**: Updated examples to use aliases
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md**: Complete rewrite with v3.2 features
- **API_REFERENCE.md**: Full documentation of new parameters
- **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md**: Practical examples using aliases
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history updated

## üöÄ What's Next

### Potential v4.0 Features
Based on user feedback, we're considering:
- Process grouping UI (show all Chrome processes together)
- Restart command (kill + execute in one step)
- Terminal UI mode for interactive process management

### Research Areas
- Advanced filtering options
- Process history tracking
- Resource usage trends

## üí¨ Developer Quote

> "After years of rebooting Windows because of stuck ports, this tool is a revelation. The orphan prevention alone would make it essential, but the MCP protection has saved me from accidentally breaking Claude Desktop multiple times. With v3.2's aliases, it's now permanently in my toolkit."
> 
> ‚Äî Senior Windows Developer (Beta Tester)

## üôè Acknowledgments

Special thanks to our beta tester who provided detailed, actionable feedback that shaped this release. The rapid iteration from feedback to deployment (2 hours) demonstrates our commitment to developer experience.

## üì¶ Installation

For new installations:
```bash
pip install psutil
# Optional for enhanced features
pip install pywin32
```

Then configure Claude Desktop as per the README.
