# Secure Dev Manager - Feature Summary Card

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

**"Why write complex, risky scripts when this tool handles everything safely?"**

---

## The Tool Solves 3 Critical Problems

### 1. 🚫 Orphaned Processes (Port Binding)
**Without Tool**: Kill parent → Children orphaned → Ports stuck → Reboot required  
**With Tool**: `kill_process_tree` → All processes die → Ports freed instantly

### 2. 💀 MCP Accidents (Breaking Claude)  
**Without Tool**: Script kills Python processes → MCP dies → Claude broken  
**With Tool**: MCP processes protected → Can't be killed → Claude stays safe

### 3. 😕 Process Confusion (What's What?)
**Without Tool**: 50 processes named "python.exe" → Which are safe?  
**With Tool**: Clear labels → Protection status → Parent-child view

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# See what's running (with children!)
@secure-dev-manager find_process python
> Shows: PID, Name, Children, Protected status

# Check if port is blocked (and by what)
@secure-dev-manager check_ports 8000
> Shows: All processes on port (parent + children)

# Kill process safely (with warning)
@secure-dev-manager kill_process 1234
> Warns: "Has 3 children, use kill_process_tree"

# Kill entire process family (no orphans!)
@secure-dev-manager kill_process_tree 1234
> Result: Parent + all children terminated

# Start background server (with tracking)
@secure-dev-manager execute_command "npm start" --background
> Manages: Process lifecycle, prevents orphans
```

## Installation TL;DR

```bash
pip install psutil          # Required
pip install pywin32         # Optional (better orphan prevention)
# Add to Claude Desktop config
# Restart Claude
# Done!
```
