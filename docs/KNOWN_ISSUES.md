# Known Issues & Improvements

## ✅ RESOLVED ISSUES (v3.1)

### Override Parameter for User-Spawned Processes [RESOLVED]
**Previous Issue**: The override parameter was implemented but not exposed in the tool schema.
**Resolution**: 
- Override parameter now properly exposed in `kill_process` tool
- Error messages updated from CLI syntax (`--override`) to MCP syntax (`override=true`)
- Documentation updated to reflect the change
- Users can now bypass user-spawned protection when needed

**Example of the fix**:
```python
# Before (didn't work):
@secure-dev-manager kill_process 12345
> Error: Process was spawned by this tool
> Add --override to force termination  # Confusing!

# After (works perfectly):
@secure-dev-manager kill_process 12345 --override
> Success: Process terminated
```

## 🔧 CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES

### 1. Script Blocking Algorithm - Overly Restrictive

**Current Issue**: The script validation is overly restrictive and blocks legitimate developer workflows.

**Examples of Unnecessary Blocking**:
```python
# Currently BLOCKED (but shouldn't be):
cleanup_database.py     # Just cleans database, no process killing
test_process_manager.py # Just a test file
data_cleanup.py        # File cleanup, not process cleanup
```

**Workaround**: Use the built-in tools directly instead of scripts:
```bash
# Instead of a cleanup script:
@secure-dev-manager find_process python
@secure-dev-manager kill_process 12345 --override
```

**Priority**: Medium - affects some workflows but has workarounds

### 2. Windows-Specific Encoding Issues

**Issue**: Some terminal outputs may have encoding issues with special characters.

**Workaround**: The tool automatically strips problematic characters in most cases.

**Priority**: Low - cosmetic issue only

## 🚀 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

### High Priority

#### 1. Process Tagging System
**Feature**: Tag processes by project for batch management
```python
# Proposed syntax:
@secure-dev-manager tag_process 12345 "project-x"
@secure-dev-manager kill_by_tag "project-x"
```
**Status**: Designed, not yet implemented

#### 2. Batch Cleanup Operations
**Feature**: Clean up all user processes except those on specific ports
```python
# Proposed syntax:
@secure-dev-manager cleanup_all --exclude-ports 3000,8000
```
**Status**: Designed, not yet implemented

### Medium Priority

#### 3. Port-to-Process Direct Mapping
**Feature**: Show which process uses which port directly in process listings
```python
# Current:
PID: 12345, Name: python.exe

# Proposed:
PID: 12345, Name: python.exe, Port: 8000
```
**Status**: Partially implemented in port checking

#### 4. Configuration File Support
**Feature**: User preferences for protection levels, default modes, etc.
```yaml
# .secure-dev-config.yaml
protection:
  user_spawned: warn  # or strict/none
performance:
  default_mode: quick
```
**Status**: Under consideration

### Low Priority

#### 5. Process Grouping by Application
**Feature**: Automatically group related processes
```
Chrome Browser:
  - Main Process (PID: 1234)
  - 15 Tab Processes
  - 3 Extension Processes
  Total Memory: 1.2GB
```
**Status**: Conceptual

#### 6. Historical Process Tracking
**Feature**: Track what processes were running when
```bash
@secure-dev-manager history --last-hour
# Shows processes that started/stopped in the last hour
```
**Status**: Conceptual
